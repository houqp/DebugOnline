DebugOnline(DBO)
================

Intro
-----

DebugOnline is a web app aims for online compiling and debugging so client side does not need to install developing tools.

This software was developed by our team during the first hackathon even held in China, so currently, it is rough coded due to the limited time we had.

Installation
------------

To deploy this app, you need a PHP supported web server. Also a basic UNIX shell environment, make, gcc and gdb should be installed.
